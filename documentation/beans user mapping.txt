- as availability setter I want supplier lists uploaded so I can then make decisions on what is made available to members
	- I want to slice available items several ways to enable swift decisions on what to cull
	- I want each 'cull' choice to be a one-click operation to save time
	- I want each 'cull' choice to be optionally automated to cut down on repetitive work
